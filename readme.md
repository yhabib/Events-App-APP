## MockUp

The final app would have two views. Only one would be implemented in the first iteration and the second one would be as extra-credit:


* Grid view:

<img align="center" width="300" src="./resources/final-project-web-grid.jpg" alt="fork this repository" />


* List view: First to be implemented

<img align="center" width="300" src="./resources/final-project-web-list.jpg" alt="fork this repository" />
